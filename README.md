# Fancy-8-Queens

The 8 Queens problem tries to solve every solution in which a Queen pieces can be placed on a chessboard without being in another's path. This program not only solves this problem, but uses 'typedef' to aid in printing a whole chessboard displaying each solution. The problem is solved by looping through a 2D array (a hypothetical chessboard), and testing if a queen can be put in that "spot". This program also uses backtracking to help prevent unnecessary comparisons.
